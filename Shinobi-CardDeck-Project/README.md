Project Overview: Shinobi Database
A dynamic React web application designed for exploring the Naruto universe. This project focuses on high-performance data fetching, custom state management, and a bold, high-contrast Manga-style UI.

 Core Functionality
Dynamic Data Fetching: Integrates with the Dattebayo API via Axios to serve real-time ninja intel.

Elite Squad Management: Implemented React Context API to allow users to "Like" and save characters to a personal squad, persisted via LocalStorage.

Smart Navigation: Features a RESTful routing system using React Router for seamless transitions between the Database, Character Intel, and Favorites.

Optimized UX: Includes Numbered Pagination for efficient browsing and Skeleton Loading States to maintain a smooth user experience during data fetching.

 Design Aesthetic
Theme: A high-energy Orange & Black color palette inspired by the classic Naruto aesthetic.

Styling: Built with Tailwind CSS, utilizing hard shadows, bold italics, and a responsive grid layout to mimic a digital "Bingo Book."
